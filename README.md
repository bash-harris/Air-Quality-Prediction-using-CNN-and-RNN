# Air-Quality-Prediction-using-CNN-and-RNN

In recent years, countries all over the world have experienced rapid urbanization. This has
resulted in a massive increase of air pollution levels and has created a major concern among the
developing countries. Therefore, demand for predicting air quality has become an absolute
necessity so that we can take precautionary measures to control the air pollution levels.
Our problem statement here is the analysis of time series meteorological data from various places
with different meteorological, temporal and spatial properties to predict and forecast air quality
index for the future time with higher accuracy and good performance.
The dataset we have considered consists of major air pollutants as well as the meteorological
data. Our plan of approach involves applying Deep Learning models to predict the AQI (Air
Quality Index), and in specific, using past AQI and meteorological data to predict the next AQI
value. The lesser the difference between the predicted and actual AQI value, the better the
model. We will further compare the above mentioned models to deduce the most efficient model
out of existing ones.
